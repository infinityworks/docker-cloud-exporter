# How to contribute

Want to get involved? Be our guests, this is a community project, built on other community projects! Always happy to welcome input from our fellow engineers.

## Submitting changes

* Fork and submit a GitHub Pull Request, with clear detail of what you've done. When you send a pull request, please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
* Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes.
